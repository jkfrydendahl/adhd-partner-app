  { text: "They're not ignoring you — their brain filters input differently. Repeat important things without frustration.", emoji: "🧠" },
  { text: "Written reminders work better than verbal ones. Try leaving a note or sending a text.", emoji: "📝" },
  { text: "Don't take unfinished tasks personally. Offer to do them together instead of pointing them out.", emoji: "🤝" },
  { text: "Celebrate small wins. Finishing a task that seems simple to you may have taken them enormous effort.", emoji: "🎉" },
  { text: "Unexpected changes are extra hard. Give as much advance notice as possible.", emoji: "📅" },
  { text: "Their emotional reactions can be intense. Validate first, problem-solve later.", emoji: "💛" },
  { text: "Time blindness is real. Help with gentle time cues instead of 'you're late again'.", emoji: "⏰" },
  { text: "A calm, clutter-free space helps their brain breathe. Tidy together, don't nag.", emoji: "🏡" },
  { text: "Routines are their anchor. Avoid disrupting established routines without discussion.", emoji: "⚓" },
  { text: "Hyperfocus isn't a choice — it's how their brain locks on. Agree on a signal to gently interrupt.", emoji: "🔍" },
  { text: "Ask 'How can I help?' instead of 'Why didn't you…?' — it changes everything.", emoji: "💬" },
  { text: "They may need to move or fidget to concentrate. Don't mistake it for not paying attention.", emoji: "🦋" },
  { text: "Rejection sensitivity is painful. Choose your words carefully when giving feedback.", emoji: "🫂" },
  { text: "Praise effort, not just results. The effort they put in is often invisible.", emoji: "⭐" },
  { text: "Use external tools together: shared calendars, reminders, checklists.", emoji: "📋" },
  { text: "Patience isn't about lowering standards — it's about understanding a different brain.", emoji: "🌱" },
  { text: "They're not lazy. Executive dysfunction makes starting tasks genuinely difficult.", emoji: "🧩" },
  { text: "Body doubling helps — just being in the same room while they work can make a huge difference.", emoji: "👥" },
  { text: "Decision fatigue is real. Reduce choices when possible (e.g., 'A or B?' instead of 'What do you want?').", emoji: "🔀" },
  { text: "Learn about ADHD together. Understanding leads to empathy, empathy leads to connection.", emoji: "📖" },
  { text: "Separate the person from the symptoms. They are not their ADHD.", emoji: "💚" },
  { text: "Transitions between tasks are hard. Give a 5-minute warning before you need them to switch.", emoji: "🔄" },
  { text: "They may forget important dates. Set shared reminders instead of testing their memory.", emoji: "🗓️" },
  { text: "Stimulation-seeking isn't reckless — their brain craves engagement. Channel it constructively.", emoji: "⚡" },
  { text: "Short, clear instructions work best. One task at a time, not a list of five.", emoji: "1️⃣" },
  { text: "They hear your tone before your words. A calm voice invites cooperation.", emoji: "🎵" },
  { text: "Don't keep score. A relationship isn't a balance sheet.", emoji: "⚖️" },
  { text: "Sleep matters enormously. Support good sleep habits without being controlling.", emoji: "😴" },
  { text: "Acknowledge that managing ADHD takes energy you can't see. They're often exhausted.", emoji: "🔋" },
  { text: "Your needs matter too. Set boundaries with love, not resentment.", emoji: "🛡️" },
